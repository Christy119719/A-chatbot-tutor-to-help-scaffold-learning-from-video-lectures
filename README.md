This project presents the design and development of a popup chatbot tutor that integrates with educational video lectures to provide real-time interactive support. The chatbot uses subtitle text from instructional videos as a knowledge base and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as semantic search and intent recognition to answer learner questions, offer clarifications, and provide scaffolded prompts.

A prototype system was built using Python, Flask, Sentence-BERT, FAISS, and spaCy, with a lightweight SQLite database for knowledge storage. The chatbot is embedded in a video player as an overlay, allowing learners to pause playback and engage in contextual conversation without leaving the learning environment.

The system was evaluated through pre- and post-tests, user surveys, and engagement metrics. Results showed improved learner comprehension, increased engagement, and positive usability and accessibility feedback, particularly for hearing-impaired and non-native learners.

While limitations such as small participant pool, static scaffolding prompts, and reliance on subtitle quality remain, the project demonstrates the feasibility and value of AI-powered tutoring agents in transforming passive video consumption into active, self-regulated learning experiences.
